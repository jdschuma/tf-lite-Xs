The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -28째 to +28째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
