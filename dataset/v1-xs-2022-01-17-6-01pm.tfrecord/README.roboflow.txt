It includes 325 images.
Xs are annotated in Tensorflow TFRecord (raccoon) format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -28째 to +28째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
